📈 Portfolio Optimization using Python

This project implements Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) using Python to optimize stock allocations for maximum returns and minimal risk. It employs Markowitz’s Efficient Frontier and Sharpe Ratio Maximization to construct an optimal investment portfolio.

The analysis is based on historical stock data fetched via yfinance and includes risk-adjusted return computations, volatility estimation, and efficient frontier visualization.

🛠️ Features
✔️ Fetches Historical Stock Data using yfinance
✔️ Computes Mean Returns & Covariance Matrix for asset risk modeling
✔️ Optimizes Portfolio via Markowitz’s Efficient Frontier
✔️ Maximizes the Sharpe Ratio for best risk-adjusted returns
✔️ Finds Minimum Volatility Portfolio (Safest Investment Option)
✔️ Plots the Efficient Frontier with 10,000 simulated portfolios
✔️ Handles Missing Data & Numerical Stability Issues

📊 Project Methodology
This project follows a structured approach to construct an optimized portfolio:

Data Collection 📥
Fetches daily stock prices for selected tickers (AAPL, GOOGL, DIS, XOM, PFE) from Yahoo Finance.
Computes daily & annualized returns.

Portfolio Analysis 📉
Computes the correlation matrix to analyze asset dependencies.
Calculates mean returns and covariance matrix for risk estimation.

Optimization Using SciPy 🏆
Max Sharpe Ratio Portfolio → Finds the best risk-adjusted return.
Minimum Volatility Portfolio → Identifies the safest allocation.

Efficient Frontier Simulation 🚀
Generates 10,000 random portfolios to visualize the risk-return tradeoff.
Highlights optimal portfolios on the Efficient Frontier Plot.

📚 Concepts Used
🔹 Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) - Portfolio diversification to maximize returns for a given risk level.
🔹 Sharpe Ratio - Measures risk-adjusted returns.
🔹 Efficient Frontier - Visual representation of optimal portfolios.
🔹 Covariance & Correlation Matrix - Measures interdependencies among stocks.

📌 Potential Improvements
🔹 Add real-time data updates
🔹 Incorporate sector-based constraints for risk control
🔹 Implement Monte Carlo simulations for better risk modeling
🔹 Extend to multi-asset portfolios (bonds, ETFs, crypto, etc.)
